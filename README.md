Going to be building a React Blog site using Next.JS instead of create-react-app so I can take advantage of API routes.

Steps:
1. Initial Step up of Barebone NextJS environment & README. DONE 
2. Install tools for testing, linting and styling.
3. Create Home page and Blog page using React.
4. Create REST services using API routes to db.json
5. Other Stuff I will add later!
